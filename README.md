# Minimalist.

I'm a full-stack engineer with 13+ years of experience. I started my career back in 2007 as a designer, then quickly started coding as well. I usually write about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React on my website.

Usually my go-to stack is NextJS and TailwindCSS, deployed on Vercel. I've built many websites and applications over the years.

I want to up my game in the open source community, 2021 might be the year to do just that.
