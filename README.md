# Minimalist.

I'm a full-stack engineer with well over a decade of experience. I started my career back in 2007 as a designer, then quickly started coding as well. I usually write about React, Next.js, TypeScrit and TailwindCSS on [my website](https://telmo.is).

If you feel like it you can throw a follow in here or check my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/telmo) profile.
